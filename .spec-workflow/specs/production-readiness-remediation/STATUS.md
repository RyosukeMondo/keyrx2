# Production Readiness Remediation - Status Report

**Generated**: 2026-01-03
**Spec**: production-readiness-remediation
**Overall Status**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - WebSocket Integration Test Infrastructure Required

## Executive Summary

The production readiness remediation effort has made **significant progress** on test infrastructure setup (Phase 1-2) and established that coverage tooling works correctly (Phase 4). However, **full production readiness is blocked** by WebSocket integration test failures that prevent both test pass rate (95%) and coverage (80%) goals from being achieved.

### Key Achievements ✅

1. **Test Infrastructure (Phase 1-2)**: Complete
   - WasmProviderWrapper test utility created
   - renderWithProviders extended with React Router support
   - Fixed 331 context provider errors across 59 test files
   - Fixed async handling issues (scrollIntoView, MSW responses, useSearchParams)
   - Test pass rate improved from 68.73% → 73.22% (555/758 passing)

2. **Coverage Infrastructure (Phase 4)**: Complete
   - @vitest/coverage-v8 installed and configured
   - 80% thresholds enforced (lines, branches, functions, statements)
   - npm script `test:coverage` working correctly
   - Text, JSON, HTML, LCOV reporters configured

3. **Critical Path Coverage (Phase 4)**: Partial Success
   - MonacoEditor.tsx: **90.32% branch coverage** ✓ (exceeds requirement)
   - useAutoSave.ts: **90.62% branch coverage** ✓ (exceeds requirement)
   - ProfilesPage, ConfigPage: Blocked by test failures

### Critical Blocker 🔴

**WebSocket Integration Test Infrastructure Missing**

- **Impact**: 203/758 tests failing (26.8%)
- **Root Cause**: react-use-websocket library requires proper WebSocket mock, current setup insufficient
- **Affected Areas**:
  - Integration tests (51 failures)
  - ProfilesPage tests (41 failures)
  - WebSocket communication tests (23 failures)
  - E2E workflows (13 failures)
  - Various component tests using useUnifiedApi hook

- **Error Pattern**:
  ```
  Error: assertIsWebSocket - WebSocket instance not found
  at react-use-websocket/src/lib/util.ts:9:74
  ```

## Detailed Test Failure Analysis

### Test Failure Categories (from task 5 audit)

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| WebSocket Errors | 23 | react-use-websocket assertIsWebSocket failures |
| Integration Tests | 51 | Full app context tests with WebSocket deps |
| ProfilesPage Tests | 41 | Async data loading + WebSocket connection |
| E2E/Performance | 17 | Should be separate from unit test suite |
| Accessibility | 7 | scrollIntoView, Modal focus, SkipToContent |
| WASM | 2 | Simulation/validation tests |
| Other Components | 37 | Various component issues |
| **TOTAL** | **203** | **26.8% failure rate** |

### Root Causes

1. **WebSocket Mocking Insufficient** (Primary Blocker)
   - react-use-websocket expects real WebSocket instance
   - Current MSW setup doesn't provide WebSocket mock
   - Need comprehensive WebSocket mock extending EventTarget with proper lifecycle

2. **Async Data Loading** (Secondary)
   - ProfilesPage tests use synchronous assertions (getBy*) on async components
   - Need conversion to async assertions (findBy*, waitFor)
   - Mock data type mismatches with expected API responses

3. **Test Suite Architecture** (Tertiary)
   - E2E tests in unit test suite (should use Playwright separately)
   - Performance tests mixed with unit tests

## Coverage Status

### Verified Coverage (Passing Tests Only)

| Component | Line % | Branch % | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| MonacoEditor.tsx | 85.91% | **90.32%** | ✅ Meets critical path requirement |
| useAutoSave.ts | **100%** | **90.62%** | ✅ Exceeds all requirements |

### Overall Coverage
- Current: ~5.3% (when running all tests due to failures)
- Target: ≥80% lines, branches, functions, statements
- Status: ⚠️ Cannot measure until test failures resolved

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Create Separate Task: WebSocket Integration Test Infrastructure** (Est. 4-6 hours)
   - Implement comprehensive WebSocket mock extending EventTarget
   - Add WebSocket lifecycle support (open, close, error, message events)
   - Integrate with MSW for WebSocket URL interception
   - Update test setup to inject WebSocket mock globally
   - Verify react-use-websocket compatibility

2. **Fix ProfilesPage Async Assertions** (Est. 1-2 hours)
   - Convert synchronous getBy* to async findBy* / waitFor
   - Align mock data formats with API responses
   - Ensure proper async/await patterns

3. **Separate E2E Tests from Unit Tests** (Est. 1 hour)
   - Move E2E tests to separate Playwright test suite
   - Remove E2E tests from vitest unit test runs
   - Update CI/CD to run E2E tests separately

### Success Criteria After WebSocket Fix

After implementing WebSocket mock infrastructure:
- ✅ Test pass rate: ≥95% (720/758 tests)
- ✅ Overall coverage: ≥80% (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- ✅ Critical path coverage: ≥90% (all 4 components)
- ✅ Full coverage reports generated (HTML, JSON, text)

### Estimated Additional Effort

- WebSocket infrastructure: **4-6 hours**
- ProfilesPage async fixes: **1-2 hours**
- E2E test separation: **1 hour**
- Verification and reporting: **1 hour**
- **Total: 7-10 hours**

## Next Steps

### For AI Agent Continuation

1. **Create new spec**: `websocket-integration-test-infrastructure`
   - Requirements: WebSocket mock, MSW integration, react-use-websocket compatibility
   - Design: EventTarget-based mock, lifecycle event support, test utilities
   - Tasks: Mock implementation, MSW setup, test integration, verification

2. **After WebSocket fix, resume**:
   - Task 9: Verify ≥95% test pass rate
   - Tasks 13-14: Coverage analysis and gap filling
   - Phase 5: Accessibility audit
   - Phase 6: Backend doc tests
   - Phase 7: Final production verification

### For Human Review

**Question**: Should we:
1. Create separate WebSocket infrastructure task and block production readiness until complete?
2. Proceed with accessibility audit (Phase 5) while WebSocket work happens in parallel?
3. Ship with current 73% test pass rate and document known limitations?

## Files Modified

- 59 test files updated with renderWithProviders

### Configuration
- `keyrx_ui/vite.config.ts` (coverage already configured)
- `keyrx_ui/package.json` (@vitest/coverage-v8 already installed)

### Documentation
- `.spec-workflow/specs/production-readiness-remediation/tasks.md` (updated)

## Quality Gates Status

| Gate | Target | Current | Status |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Test Pass Rate | ≥95% | 73.22% | ⚠️ BLOCKED |
| Overall Coverage | ≥80% | ~5.3%* | ⚠️ BLOCKED |
| Critical Path Coverage | ≥90% | 2/4 verified at ≥90% | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) | 0 violations | Not tested | ⏸️ PENDING |
| Backend Doc Tests | 100% pass | Not tested | ⏸️ PENDING |

\* Coverage measurement blocked by test failures

## Conclusion

**Significant infrastructure improvements have been made**, but **production readiness is blocked by WebSocket integration test infrastructure**. The critical path forward is:

1. Implement WebSocket mock infrastructure (new spec/task)
2. Resume production-readiness-remediation at task 9
3. Complete remaining phases (5-7)

**Recommendation**: Create `websocket-integration-test-infrastructure` spec as dependency blocker for this spec.
