## Notes

- Tasks 1-5 are infrastructure, must complete first
- Tasks 6-14 are tests, can be done in parallel after infrastructure
- Tasks 15-16 are integration, complete last
- All tests should use fixtures from tasks 2-4
- Network efficiency tests (task 14) specifically catch the rapid PATCH bug pattern
