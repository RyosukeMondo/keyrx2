# improve-web-ui - Tasks

## Overview
General UI/UX improvements for the KeyRX Web UI excluding key palette (separate spec) and WASM (separate spec).

## Task 1: Narrow Layer Switcher Width

- [x] 1.1 Refactor LayerSwitcher to fixed narrow width
  - File: `keyrx_ui/src/components/LayerSwitcher.tsx`
  - Change from full-width to fixed narrow width (~80px / 7 chars)
  - Layers are predictable: "Base", "MD_00", "MD_FF" (max 7 chars)
  - Use `w-20` or similar Tailwind class for consistent narrow width
  - Keep vertical scrollable layout
  - Purpose: Reduce horizontal space, allow room for keyboard layouts
  - _Leverage: keyrx_ui/src/components/LayerSwitcher.tsx existing implementation_
  - _Requirements: Narrow layer switcher with predictable width_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec improve-web-ui, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: React UI Developer | Task: Refactor LayerSwitcher to use fixed narrow width (~80px) since layer names are predictable (Base, MD_00-MD_FF). Replace responsive width with Tailwind w-20 or w-[80px]. Maintain scroll behavior and search. | Restrictions: Keep existing functionality, don't break layer selection | Success: LayerSwitcher renders at consistent narrow width, fits alongside keyboard layouts | After completion: Mark task [-] as in-progress in tasks.md before starting, use log-implementation tool to record artifacts, then mark [x] complete_

  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec improve-web-ui, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: React UI Developer | Task: Add pane headers "Global Keys" and "Device: [selector]" above respective keyboard views. Move device selector to device pane header. Add subtle background tint (slate-50 vs zinc-50) to distinguish panes. | Restrictions: Keep existing device selection logic, maintain accessibility | Success: Each pane clearly labeled, device selector in correct location | After completion: Mark task [-] as in-progress in tasks.md before starting, use log-implementation tool to record artifacts, then mark [x] complete_
