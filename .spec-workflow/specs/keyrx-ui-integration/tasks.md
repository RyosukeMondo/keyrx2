  - _Leverage: GitHub Actions_
  - _Requirements: REQ-8 (AC10)_
  - _Prompt: Role: DevOps Engineer with expertise in GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines | Task: Modify .github/workflows/ci.yml to: checkout code, setup Rust stable + wasm32-unknown-unknown target, setup Node.js 18, install wasm-pack, cache cargo and npm dependencies, run scripts/build.sh, run scripts/verify.sh, upload coverage reports to artifact, fail build if any step fails; modify .github/workflows/release.yml (triggered on tag push) to: build for Linux and Windows targets, create release artifacts (binaries, UI bundle), create GitHub release with changelog, upload artifacts to release, test CI by pushing to branch | Restrictions: CI must run on push and pull_request, dependencies must be cached for speed, all steps must be logged, coverage upload required, release only on tag push, multi-platform builds mandatory | Success: CI workflow runs on push/PR, builds WASM → UI → daemon, runs all verifications, uploads coverage, caches work correctly, release workflow builds for Linux/Windows, creates GitHub release with binaries, all steps logged, failures stop pipeline_

- [ ] 47. Migrate keyrx_ui_v2 to keyrx_ui
  - File: keyrx_ui/ (remove old), keyrx_ui_v2/ (rename to keyrx_ui), scripts/, keyrx_daemon/build.rs, Cargo.toml, .github/workflows/
  - Remove old keyrx_ui directory completely
  - Rename keyrx_ui_v2 to keyrx_ui
  - Update all references in build scripts, Cargo.toml, daemon build.rs, CI workflows
  - Purpose: Finalize migration by removing temporary _v2 suffix
  - _Leverage: git mv for rename with history preservation_
  - _Requirements: All (final cleanup)_
  - _Prompt: Role: DevOps Engineer with expertise in repository migrations and git workflows | Task: Remove old keyrx_ui directory (rm -rf keyrx_ui after backing up any needed files like Monaco integration code), rename keyrx_ui_v2 to keyrx_ui using git mv to preserve history, update all references: scripts/build_wasm.sh (change ../keyrx_ui_v2/src/wasm/pkg to ../keyrx_ui/src/wasm/pkg), scripts/build_ui.sh (cd keyrx_ui instead of keyrx_ui_v2), keyrx_daemon/build.rs (../keyrx_ui/dist instead of ../keyrx_ui_v2/dist), keyrx_daemon/src/web/static_files.rs (update include_dir path), CI workflows (.github/workflows/ update paths), verify build works after migration | Restrictions: Must use git mv not regular mv to preserve git history, must verify old keyrx_ui has no needed code before deletion, all build scripts must be updated, must test complete build after migration | Success: Old keyrx_ui removed, keyrx_ui_v2 renamed to keyrx_ui with git history preserved, all build scripts updated and working, daemon embeds from keyrx_ui/dist, CI passes, no references to keyrx_ui_v2 remain in codebase_

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 47 atomic implementation tasks across 8 phases (+ final migration)

**Task Status Tracking**:
- Use `- [ ]` for pending tasks
- Use `- [-]` for in-progress tasks (mark ONE at a time)
- Use `- [x]` for completed tasks

**Critical Dependencies**:
- Tasks 1-9 (RPC Backend) must complete before 10-14 (RPC Frontend)
- Task 15 (Monaco) depends on 16 (WASM hook)
- Tasks 18-22 (Dashboard) depend on 10-14 (RPC Client)
- Task 23 (Config Tabs) depends on 15 (Monaco)
- Tasks 25-29 (WASM) can run in parallel with Phase 1
- Tasks 30-34 (Responsive) depend on components existing
- Tasks 35-40 (Testing) run throughout all phases
- Tasks 41-46 (Build) support all phases
- Task 47 (Migration) is the FINAL task after everything works

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Phase 1: 2 weeks (RPC API)
- Phase 2: 1 week (Monaco)
- Phase 3: 1 week (Dashboard)
- Phase 4: 0.5 weeks (Tabs)
- Phase 5: 1 week (WASM)
- Phase 6: 1 week (Responsive)
- Phase 7: 1.5 weeks (Testing)
- Phase 8: 1 week (Build + Migration)

**Total**: 9-10 weeks with 1 developer, or ~6 weeks with parallel development

**When to Remove keyrx_ui_v2**:
- Task 47 is the LAST task after all others complete
- Do NOT remove keyrx_ui_v2 until:
  - All 46 implementation tasks are done
  - All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E, visual, accessibility, performance)
  - CI/CD pipeline is green
  - Production build works
- Then execute Task 47 to finalize the migration
