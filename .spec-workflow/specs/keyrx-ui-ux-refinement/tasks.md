  - _Requirements: R3, R4_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec keyrx-ui-ux-refinement, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Rust Test Engineer with expertise in integration testing and async testing | Task: Write integration tests for ProfileManager covering create, activate (success and failure), delete operations following requirements R3 and R4. Use tempfile crate for isolated test directories, mock compiler and daemon control | Restrictions: Must use async test runtime (tokio::test), ensure test isolation (separate temp dirs), test both success and failure paths, clean up resources, use assert macros for clear failures | Success: All tests pass, profile creation verified, activation flow tested (compile + persist + reload), rollback tested (compilation error), deletion tested, no test pollution (isolated temp dirs), >85% code coverage | Instructions: After completing the task, run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then update tasks.md to mark this task as in-progress [-], log the implementation with log-implementation tool including detailed artifacts (test files, integration scenarios covered), and mark as complete [x] when done_

- [ ] 21. Write E2E tests for visual config editor in keyrx_ui/tests/e2e/config-editor.spec.ts
  - File: keyrx_ui/tests/e2e/config-editor.spec.ts
  - Test drag-drop flow (drag key from palette to keyboard)
  - Test device scope toggle (global ↔ device-specific)
  - Test layer switching (base → vim → gaming)
  - Test auto-save (changes persist on refresh)
  - Test error handling (invalid config rejected)
  - Purpose: Validate complete visual editor user flow
  - _Leverage: Playwright or Cypress, mock backend_
  - _Requirements: R5_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec keyrx-ui-ux-refinement, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: QA Automation Engineer with expertise in E2E testing and Playwright/Cypress | Task: Write end-to-end tests for visual config editor covering drag-drop, scope toggle, layer switching, auto-save, and error handling following requirement R5. Use Playwright or Cypress with mock backend | Restrictions: Must test real user interactions (mouse/keyboard), use data-testid for selectors (not CSS classes), ensure tests are deterministic (no flaky tests), clean state between tests, run in headless mode for CI | Success: All E2E tests pass reliably, drag-drop flow is validated end-to-end, auto-save persistence is verified (refresh test), error handling prevents invalid saves, tests run in CI without flakiness, critical user journeys are covered | Instructions: After completing the task, run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then update tasks.md to mark this task as in-progress [-], log the implementation with log-implementation tool including detailed artifacts (test files, user journeys covered), and mark as complete [x] when done_

- [ ] 22. Update documentation in docs/ui-ux-refinement.md
  - File: docs/ui-ux-refinement.md
  - Document new visual editor usage
  - Document profile-config integration workflow
  - Add screenshots of new UI components
  - Document auto-save behavior
  - Purpose: User-facing documentation for new features
  - _Leverage: existing docs structure_
  - _Requirements: All_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec keyrx-ui-ux-refinement, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Technical Writer with expertise in user documentation and UI/UX | Task: Create comprehensive documentation for UI/UX refinement covering visual editor, profile-config workflow, auto-save behavior, with screenshots following all requirements. Use existing docs structure for consistency | Restrictions: Must use clear language (avoid jargon), include screenshots for visual features, provide step-by-step instructions, maintain existing doc format (markdown), ensure accessibility (alt text for images) | Success: Documentation covers all new features, step-by-step guides are clear and accurate, screenshots illustrate key workflows, language is user-friendly, doc structure matches existing docs | Instructions: After completing the task, run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then update tasks.md to mark this task as in-progress [-], log the implementation with log-implementation tool including detailed artifacts (documentation files created), and mark as complete [x] when done_
