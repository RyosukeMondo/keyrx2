# UAT UI Fixes - Tasks

## Overview
Fix UI issues identified during User Acceptance Testing for Dashboard, Devices, Profiles, Config, and Layers pages.

---

## Task 1: Dashboard - Add Virtual/Physical Device Indicator

- [x] 1.1 Add device type detection to API/types
  - File: `src/types/index.ts`, `src/api/devices.ts`
  - Add `isVirtual: boolean` field to DeviceEntry interface
  - Detection logic: device name starts with "keyrx" = virtual (uinput-created)
  - Purpose: Distinguish daemon-created virtual keyboards from physical hardware
  - _Leverage: src/types/index.ts, src/api/devices.ts_
  - _Requirements: Dashboard shows clear indicator for virtual vs physical device_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec uat-ui-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Frontend TypeScript Developer | Task: Add isVirtual boolean field to DeviceEntry interface and implement detection in API layer. Virtual devices are those with name "keyrx" (the daemon's uinput device). Update fetchDevices to populate this field. | Restrictions: Do not modify backend API, derive from existing device name field, maintain backward compatibility | Success: DeviceEntry has isVirtual field, fetchDevices correctly identifies virtual device | After completion: Mark task [-] as in-progress in tasks.md before starting, use log-implementation tool to record artifacts, then mark [x] complete_

- [ ] 1.2 Add virtual device badge to Dashboard
  - File: `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`, `src/components/StateIndicatorPanel.tsx`
  - Add visual indicator (icon/badge) showing "Virtual" or "Physical" for each device
  - Virtual: show computer/software icon with "Virtual" label
  - Physical: show keyboard hardware icon with "Hardware" label
  - Purpose: Users can distinguish daemon output device from real keyboards
  - _Leverage: src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx, existing icon patterns_
  - _Requirements: Clear visual distinction between virtual and physical devices_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec uat-ui-fixes: Role: React/UI Developer | Task: Add device type badges to device cards on Dashboard. Use distinct icons/colors - Virtual (purple/software icon), Physical (gray/keyboard icon). Show badge next to device name. | Restrictions: Follow existing badge styling patterns, ensure accessibility with aria-labels | Success: Each device clearly shows if it's virtual or physical hardware | After completion: Use log-implementation tool, mark [x] complete_

## Task 2: Devices Page - Replace Delete with Enable/Disable Toggle

- [ ] 2.1 Add enabled/disabled state to device management
  - File: `src/types/index.ts`, `src/api/devices.ts`, `src/hooks/useDevices.ts`
  - Add `enabled: boolean` field to DeviceEntry (default: true)
  - Add `setDeviceEnabled(id, enabled)` API function
  - Persist enabled state to backend or localStorage
  - Purpose: Allow users to hide devices without "forgetting" them

- [ ] 2.2 Replace delete button with enable/disable toggle
  - File: `src/pages/DevicesPage.tsx`
  - Replace ✕ delete button with toggle switch
  - Disabled devices appear grayed out with reduced opacity
  - Remove confirmation modal (no longer needed for toggle)
  - Add visual indicator when device is disabled
  - Purpose: Intuitive on/off control without permanent deletion
  - _Leverage: src/pages/DevicesPage.tsx DeviceRow component_
  - _Requirements: Toggle switch UI, grayed out disabled devices_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec uat-ui-fixes: Role: React UI Developer | Task: Replace delete button (✕) with toggle switch in DeviceRow. When disabled: row has opacity:0.5, gray overlay, "(Disabled)" badge. Toggle triggers setDeviceEnabled. Remove forget confirmation modal. | Restrictions: Maintain existing device info display, ensure keyboard accessible toggle | Success: Toggle works, disabled devices visually distinct, no delete functionality | After completion: Use log-implementation tool, mark [x] complete_

- [ ] 2.3 Filter disabled devices from Config page
  - File: `src/pages/ConfigPage.tsx`, `src/components/DeviceSelector.tsx`
  - Don't show disabled devices in DeviceSelector dropdown
  - Don't include disabled devices in merged device list
  - Purpose: Disabled devices shouldn't appear in configuration
  - _Leverage: src/pages/ConfigPage.tsx, src/components/DeviceSelector.tsx_
  - _Requirements: Disabled devices not shown in config page_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec uat-ui-fixes: Role: React Developer | Task: Filter out devices where enabled===false from ConfigPage mergedDevices list and DeviceSelector dropdown. Add filter before mapping. | Restrictions: Keep Rhai-defined disconnected devices, only filter user-disabled devices | Success: Disabled devices don't appear in config page device selector | After completion: Use log-implementation tool, mark [x] complete_

- [ ] 2.4 Add unit tests for device enable/disable
  - File: `src/__tests__/DevicesPage.test.tsx` (create or extend)
  - Test toggle functionality
  - Test disabled device visual state
  - Test filtering in ConfigPage

  - _Requirements: Test coverage for new functionality_
  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec uat-ui-fixes: Role: QA Engineer | Task: Write unit tests for device enable/disable: 1) Toggle changes enabled state, 2) Disabled devices have opacity styling, 3) Disabled devices filtered from ConfigPage. Use renderWithProviders and mock API. | Restrictions: Follow existing test patterns, use React Testing Library | Success: All tests pass, covers happy path and edge cases | After completion: Use log-implementation tool, mark [x] complete_
