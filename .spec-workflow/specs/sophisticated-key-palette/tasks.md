# sophisticated-key-palette - Tasks

## Overview
Implement a sophisticated key palette inspired by QMK Configurator and VIA, with comprehensive key categories, search functionality, and intuitive selection UX.

## Research Summary
Based on QMK Configurator and VIA best practices:
- **VIA Categories**: Basic, Lighting, Media, Macro, Layers, Special, Other
- **QMK Pattern**: Drag-and-drop, click-select, physical key input
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Common keys first, advanced via search/Any key
- **Hover Tooltips**: Brief explanations without overwhelming
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Keyboard updates during remapping
