The primary focus is fixing test failures, verifying code coverage, and ensuring accessibility compliance to meet production deployment standards.\n\n**Purpose:** Remediate 204 failing frontend tests, verify ≥80% code coverage, and pass WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility audit.\n\n**Value to Stakeholders:**\n- **Development Team:** Confident production deployment with verified quality gates\n- **QA Team:** Comprehensive test coverage and automated verification\n- **End Users:** Accessible, well-tested application with WCAG 2.2 compliance\n- **Product Owners:** Production-ready codebase meeting all quality standards\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis remediation supports KeyRX's **AI Coding Agent First** principle (product.md):\n- **Zero Manual Testing:** Automated tests must pass before deployment\n- **Structured Logging:** Test results in machine-readable format\n- **Quality Metrics:** Enforce 80% minimum coverage (per product.md Success Metrics)\n- **Accessibility as Standard:** WCAG 2.2 compliance ensures inclusive design\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Fix MonacoEditor Test Failures\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want MonacoEditor component tests to pass, so that I can confidently deploy code editor functionality to production.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN MonacoEditor tests run THEN all 36 tests SHALL pass without errors\n2. WHEN MonacoEditor component renders in test THEN it SHALL be wrapped with WasmProvider context\n3. WHEN test setup uses renderWithProviders helper THEN WasmProvider SHALL be included by default\n4. WHEN all MonacoEditor tests pass THEN test coverage SHALL include validation logic, error handling, and syntax highlighting\n\n### Requirement 2: Fix Remaining Frontend Test Failures\n\n**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want all frontend tests to pass (≥95% pass rate), so that I can verify application stability before production.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN frontend test suite runs THEN pass rate SHALL be ≥95% (≥655/689 tests)\n2. WHEN context-dependent components render in tests THEN appropriate providers SHALL be included\n3. WHEN async operations complete in tests THEN proper wait helpers SHALL be used (waitFor, act)\n4. WHEN test files fail THEN specific failure causes SHALL be documented and fixed\n5. IF test failures are due to test setup issues THEN test utilities SHALL be updated\n\n### Requirement 3: Verify Test Coverage ≥80%\n\n**User Story:** As a tech lead, I want test coverage verified at ≥80%, so that critical paths are protected from regressions.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN coverage tool runs THEN it SHALL generate line, branch, and function coverage reports\n2. WHEN coverage analysis completes THEN overall coverage SHALL be ≥80%\n3. WHEN critical paths (keyrx_core equivalents) are analyzed THEN coverage SHALL be ≥90%\n4. WHEN coverage report is generated THEN it SHALL identify uncovered lines for targeted test additions\n5. IF coverage is below 80% THEN additional tests SHALL be written before approval\n\n### Requirement 4: Pass WCAG 2.2 Level AA Accessibility Audit\n\n**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the application to pass WCAG 2.2 Level AA audit, so that we meet accessibility standards and avoid legal risks.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN automated accessibility tests run THEN they SHALL pass with zero violations\n2. WHEN keyboard navigation is tested THEN all interactive elements SHALL be keyboard-accessible\n3. WHEN color contrast is verified THEN all text SHALL meet 4.5:1 ratio (normal text) or 3:1 (large text)\n4. WHEN ARIA labels are audited THEN all interactive elements SHALL have descriptive labels\n5. WHEN screen reader compatibility is tested THEN all content SHALL be properly announced\n6. WHEN focus management is verified THEN focus SHALL be visible and follow logical order\n\n### Requirement 5: Fix Backend Doc Test Compilation\n\n**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want doc tests to compile and pass, so that code examples in documentation are verified.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN backend doc tests run THEN they SHALL compile without version mismatch errors\n2. WHEN cargo clean is executed THEN crate version conflicts SHALL be resolved\n3. WHEN doc tests execute THEN all examples SHALL pass\n4. IF doc tests fail THEN examples in documentation SHALL be corrected\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Test utilities shall have focused purposes (e.g., renderWithProviders only handles provider setup)\n- **Modular Design**: Create reusable test helpers (WasmProviderWrapper, AccessibilityTestHelper)\n- **Dependency Management**: Coverage tool and accessibility test dependencies properly installed\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Test helper functions with clear TypeScript signatures\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Test Execution Time:** Full test suite shall complete in <60 seconds (currently 22.72s frontend + 10.11s backend = 32.83s ✓)\n- **Coverage Analysis:** Coverage report generation shall complete in <30 seconds\n- **CI Pipeline Impact:** Remediation shall not increase CI build time by >10%\n\n### Security\n\n- **Dependency Audit:** New test dependencies (@vitest/coverage-v8) shall have zero high/critical vulnerabilities\n- **Test Data:** Test fixtures shall not contain real user data or credentials\n- **Coverage Reports:** Shall not expose sensitive code paths in public reports\n\n### Reliability\n\n- **Test Stability:** All tests shall be deterministic (no flaky tests allowed)\n- **Coverage Accuracy:** Coverage metrics shall reflect actual code execution (no false positives)\n- **Accessibility Tests:** Shall catch regressions automatically in CI\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Developer Experience:** Test failures shall have clear error messages\n- **Coverage Reports:** Shall be human-readable with clear actionable insights\n- **Accessibility Audit:** Shall provide specific fix recommendations for violations\n- **Documentation:** All test helpers shall have JSDoc comments with examples\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore production deployment, the following gates must pass:\n\n| Gate | Metric | Threshold | Current |\n|------|--------|-----------|---------|\n| Frontend Tests | Pass Rate | ≥95% | 70% ❌ |\n| Backend Tests | Pass Rate | 100% | 100% ✅ |\n| Test Coverage | Line Coverage | ≥80% | Unknown ❌ |\n| Test Coverage | Branch Coverage | ≥80% | Unknown ❌ |\n| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA | Zero Violations | Unknown ❌ |\n| Doc Tests | Compilation | 100% Success | Failing ❌ |\n\n**Production Approval:** Requires ALL gates to pass ✅\n",
