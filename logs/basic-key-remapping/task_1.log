# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec basic-key-remapping. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 26 has been completed successfully. Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Task 26 Completion Summary

I successfully completed task 26 (Final integration, benchmarking, and documentation) for the basic-key-remapping spec. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Test Suite (382 tests passing)
- All unit tests pass (56 for runtime, 27 for daemon, plus compiler tests)
- All integration tests pass (15 end-to-end scenarios)
- All property-based tests pass with 100+ iterations
- End-to-end workflows verified

### ✅ Benchmarks (All targets exceeded)
Performance benchmarks demonstrate exceptional results, exceeding all targets:
- **key_lookup**: ~4.7ns (target: <10μs) - 2,127x faster than required
- **state_update_set_modifier**: ~1.4ns (target: <10μs) - 7,142x faster
- **state_update_toggle_lock**: ~2.2ns (target: <10μs) - 4,545x faster
- **process_event_simple**: ~17ns (target: <1ms) - 58,823x faster
- **process_event_modifier**: ~10ns (target: <1ms) - 100,000x faster
- **process_event_passthrough**: ~15ns (target: <1ms) - 66,666x faster

### ✅ Documentation (CHANGELOG.md updated)
Comprehensive documentation added covering:
- DeviceState (255-bit state tracking)
- KeyLookup (O(1) resolution)
- Event processing engine
- Platform abstraction layer
- EventProcessor orchestrator
- Testing infrastructure
- Performance benchmarks

### ✅ Example Code (runtime_example.rs)
Created a comprehensive example demonstrating:
1. DeviceState management (modifiers and locks)
2. KeyLookup table building and resolution
3. Event processing with all mapping types
4. Complete EventProcessor pipeline with mock devices
5. Vim navigation layer implementation (CapsLock + HJKL → arrows)

All examples compile and run successfully.

### ✅ Task Completion
- Marked task 26 as completed in tasks.md
- All spec requirements verified and met
- Committed all changes with comprehensive commit message

The basic-key-remapping spec (Phase 2) implementation is now complete!
