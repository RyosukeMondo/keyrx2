# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec basic-key-remapping. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Perfect! Task 17 is now complete and committed. The ConfigLoader module has been successfully implemented with:

- `load_config` function that reads and validates .krx binary files
- `ConfigError` enum with proper error handling for I/O and deserialization errors
- Comprehensive tests covering valid files, missing files, corrupted magic bytes, and corrupted hashes
- Integration with keyrx_compiler's deserialize function
- All tests passing, code formatted, and clippy checks passing

The implementation followed the task requirements:
- Defined `load_config<P: AsRef<Path>>` that returns `Result<&'static rkyv::Archived<ConfigRoot>, ConfigError>`
- Created `ConfigError` enum wrapping I/O and deserialization errors using thiserror
- Read file bytes and called `keyrx_compiler::serialize::deserialize`
- Added proper documentation with examples
- Added rkyv and tempfile dependencies
