# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec core-config-system. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! I've successfully completed tasks 1, 2, and 3. Let me summarize what's been accomplished:

## Completed Tasks:

1. **Task 1 - Version struct**: ✅ Committed
   - Added Version struct with major, minor, patch fields (u8)
   - Derived rkyv traits and implemented Display
   - Added unit tests

2. **Task 2 - KeyCode enum**: ✅ Committed  
   - Created comprehensive KeyCode enum with 100+ keys
   - Organized by category (letters, numbers, function keys, modifiers, special keys, arrows, numpad, media, system, browser, application)
   - All variants explicitly numbered with #[repr(u16)]

3. **Task 3 - Condition enum**: ✅ Committed
   - Defined ConditionItem and Condition enums
   - Implemented 4 variants supporting conditional mappings
   - Resolved rkyv recursion issue by flattening NotActive to use Vec instead of Box<Condition>

The core config system is progressing well. The next task would be to implement the KeyMapping enum with 6 variants (task 4), which will build on these foundation types.
