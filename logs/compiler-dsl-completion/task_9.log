# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec compiler-dsl-completion. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 13 has been completed and committed successfully. The compile subcommand handler is now fully implemented with:

1. **Core functionality**:
   - Parses Rhai scripts using `Parser::parse_script()`
   - Serializes configuration to .krx binary format using `serialize()`
   - Writes output file to disk
   - Displays progress messages during compilation
   - Shows success message with file size and SHA256 hash

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Added `hex` crate for hash encoding

3. **Testing**:
   - Created comprehensive integration tests covering success cases, parse errors, file not found, and complex configurations
   - All tests pass successfully

The implementation has been logged and committed. Task 13 is complete!
