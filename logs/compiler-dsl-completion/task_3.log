# Prompt
Work on the single next task for spec compiler-dsl-completion. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! Task 27 is complete with comprehensive property-based tests for the parser. The implementation includes:

- **7 proptest strategies** for generating random valid Rhai scripts
- **7 property tests** (100 cases each = 700+ iterations) covering:
  - Parser handles any valid script structure without panicking
  - Parsed ConfigRoot serializes successfully
  - Simple map() statements work correctly
  - tap_hold() statements produce valid mappings
  - Conditional blocks work as expected
  - Multiple devices parse correctly
  - Round-trip consistency (parse → serialize → deserialize)
- **6 edge case tests** for empty devices, 100 mappings, nested conditionals, modifier helpers, and mixed mapping types
- **All 24 tests pass** successfully

The commit has been made with a clear message documenting the implementation. Task 27 is now complete and I'm ready to proceed to task 28: Final integration and cleanup.
