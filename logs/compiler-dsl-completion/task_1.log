Work on the single next task for spec compiler-dsl-completion. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

Excellent! Task 25 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Task 25 Complete: CI Documentation Accuracy Checks

I've successfully added CI checks to ensure documentation stays accurate as code evolves:

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**:
   - Added new `test-docs` job that runs after the `verify` job completes
   - Job builds compiler in release mode and tests all 6 example `.rhai` files
   - Extracts code blocks from `docs/DSL_MANUAL.md` using awk for validation
   - CI will fail with exit code 1 if any example fails to compile

2. **Created `scripts/test_docs.sh`**:
   - Local testing script that mirrors CI behavior
   - Builds compiler and compiles all examples
   - Extracts and validates documentation code blocks
   - Provides clear success/failure messages

3. **Updated `scripts/CLAUDE.md`**:
   - Added `test_docs.sh` to the Script Reference Table
   - Added examples section showing how to use the script
   - Documents the script's purpose and behavior

4. **Updated `tasks.md`**:
   - Marked task 25 as complete with implementation details

### Verification:
- All 6 example files compile successfully locally
- CI workflow YAML is valid
- Script is executable and works correctly
- Documentation is complete and accurate

The CI will now automatically verify that all documentation examples remain valid and compilable on every PR, preventing documentation drift.
