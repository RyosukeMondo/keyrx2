Work on the single next task for spec compiler-dsl-completion. When you complete a logical unit of work, you MUST run 'git add' followed by 'git commit' with a clear message. DO NOT just stage files - you must actually commit them. DO NOT ask permission - just commit immediately when work is done. Make atomic commits for each semantic group of changes.

# Output (stdout + stderr)
Excellent! I have successfully completed task 23 for the compiler-dsl-completion spec. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 23 Complete: Example Configurations Created ✓

I created 6 comprehensive Rhai configuration examples demonstrating different keyrx DSL features:

### Examples Created:

1. **01-simple-remap.rhai** (176 bytes) - Basic key remapping showing the fundamentals: A→B, Q→W, 1→2

2. **02-capslock-escape.rhai** (128 bytes) - The classic CapsLock→Escape remap popular with Vim/Emacs users

3. **03-vim-navigation.rhai** (240 bytes) - Vim-style HJKL navigation using custom modifier MD_00, with extended navigation (Page Up/Down, Home/End)

4. **04-dual-function-keys.rhai** (392 bytes) - Demonstrates tap_hold() functionality with:
   - CapsLock: tap=Esc, hold=Ctrl (with Ctrl+C/V/X shortcuts)
   - Space: tap=Space, hold=navigation layer
   - Enter: tap=Enter, hold=Shift

5. **05-multiple-devices.rhai** (672 bytes) - Device-specific configurations for:
   - Laptop keyboard (minimal changes)
   - External Keychron keyboard (full layer setup)
   - Fallback wildcard pattern for other devices

6. **06-advanced-layers.rhai** (968 bytes) - Complex multi-layer setup with:
   - Nav/Symbol/Number/Function layers via 4 dual-function keys
   - Gaming mode toggle using LK_00
   - Layer stacking examples

### Key Features:
- All examples compile successfully without errors
- Comprehensive header comments explaining purpose and expected behavior
- Inline comments for each mapping
- Correct KeyCode names (fixed OEM* keys, media keys, etc.)
- Uses when_start()/when_end() syntax matching actual implementation
- Compilation instructions included in each file

### Commits Made:
1. `docs(examples): add 6 comprehensive Rhai configuration examples` - Added all 6 example files
2. `docs: mark task 23 complete in tasks.md` - Updated task tracking

All examples were tested and verified to compile successfully!
