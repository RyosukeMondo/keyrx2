//! End-to-End Integration Tests
//!
//! These tests validate complete system behavior with realistic user scenarios:
//! - Vim-style navigation layers with complex key combinations
//! - Lock state persistence across multiple key presses
//! - Multi-device configurations with independent state management
//!
//! Unlike processor_tests.rs which tests individual features, these tests
//! simulate real-world usage patterns and workflows.
