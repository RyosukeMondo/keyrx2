//! Virtual keyboard for test input injection.
//!
//! This module provides [`VirtualKeyboard`] for creating a virtual input device
//! that can inject key events into the kernel for E2E testing.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use keyrx_daemon::test_utils::VirtualKeyboard;
//! use keyrx_core::runtime::event::KeyEvent;
//! use keyrx_core::config::KeyCode;
//!
//! // Create a virtual keyboard with unique name
//! let mut keyboard = VirtualKeyboard::create("test")?;
//!
//! // Inject key events
//! keyboard.inject(KeyEvent::Press(KeyCode::A))?;
//! keyboard.inject(KeyEvent::Release(KeyCode::A))?;
//!
//! // Device is automatically cleaned up on drop
//! ```
//!
//! # Requirements
//!
//! - Linux with uinput support (`/dev/uinput`)
//! - Read/write access to uinput (typically requires `input` group membership or root)

/// A virtual keyboard device for injecting test key events.
///
/// Uses Linux's uinput subsystem to create a virtual input device that appears
/// to the system as a real keyboard. Events injected through this device flow
/// through the kernel's input subsystem and can be captured by applications
/// (including the keyrx daemon for E2E testing).
///
/// # Device Naming
///
/// Each virtual keyboard is created with a unique name that includes:
/// - A user-provided base name
/// - A timestamp-based suffix for uniqueness
///
/// This ensures parallel tests can each create their own virtual keyboard
/// without name collisions.
///
/// # Cleanup
///
/// The device is automatically destroyed when the `VirtualKeyboard` is dropped,
/// ensuring no orphaned virtual devices are left in `/dev/input/`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut keyboard = VirtualKeyboard::create("e2e-test")?;
/// println!("Created: {}", keyboard.name());
///
/// // Inject a key tap (press + release)
/// keyboard.inject(KeyEvent::Press(KeyCode::A))?;
/// keyboard.inject(KeyEvent::Release(KeyCode::A))?;
/// ```
