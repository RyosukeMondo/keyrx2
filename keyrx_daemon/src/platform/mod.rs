//! Platform abstraction layer for keyboard input/output.
//!
//! This module provides a trait-based abstraction for platform-specific keyboard
//! input capture and output injection. The [`Platform`] trait defines the contract
//! for all platform implementations, enabling dependency injection and testability.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The module follows the dependency inversion principle:
//! - High-level daemon code depends on the [`Platform`] trait abstraction
//! - Platform-specific code (Linux, Windows) implements the trait
//! - Factory function [`create_platform()`] creates platform-specific instances
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use keyrx_daemon::platform::create_platform;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let mut platform = create_platform()?;
//!     platform.initialize()?;
//!
//!     loop {
//!         let event = platform.capture_input()?;
//!         // Process event...
//!         platform.inject_output(event)?;
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # System Tray Support
//!
//! The [`SystemTray`] trait provides a cross-platform interface for system tray
//! icons with menu support. Each platform implements this trait using native
//! tray APIs:
//! - Linux: Uses `ksni` crate for StatusNotifierItem/D-Bus protocol
//! - Windows: Uses `tray-icon` crate for native Windows tray API
//!
//! The tray provides "Reload Config" and "Exit" menu items via [`TrayControlEvent`].

/// Platform abstraction for keyboard input/output operations.
///
/// This trait provides a unified interface for platform-specific keyboard event
/// capture and injection. Implementations exist for Linux (evdev/uinput) and
/// Windows (Low-Level Hooks/SendInput).
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All implementations must be `Send + Sync` to support concurrent access from
/// the daemon event loop and web API handlers.
///
/// # Object Safety
///
/// This trait is object-safe, meaning it can be used as `Box<dyn Platform>`.
/// This enables dependency injection and runtime polymorphism.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// use keyrx_daemon::platform::{create_platform, Platform};
/// use keyrx_core::runtime::event::KeyEvent;
///
/// fn run_event_loop(mut platform: Box<dyn Platform>) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
///     platform.initialize()?;
///
///     loop {
///         let event = platform.capture_input()?;
///         // Process event through keyrx_core runtime...
///         platform.inject_output(event)?;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Platform Support
///
/// - **Linux**: Uses evdev for input capture, uinput for output injection
/// - **Windows**: Uses Low-Level Keyboard Hook for input, SendInput API for output
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// 1. Create platform instance via [`create_platform()`]
/// 2. Call [`initialize()`](Platform::initialize) to set up resources
/// 3. Call [`capture_input()`](Platform::capture_input) and [`inject_output()`](Platform::inject_output) in event loop
/// 4. Call [`shutdown()`](Platform::shutdown) to clean up resources
