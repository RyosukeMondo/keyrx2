//! Platform abstraction layer for keyboard input/output.
//!
//! This module defines traits for input and output devices, providing a
//! platform-agnostic interface for event processing. Platform-specific
//! implementations (Linux, Windows, Mock) implement these traits.

/// - `grab()`: Obtains exclusive access to the device, preventing other applications
///   from receiving events from this device.
/// - `release()`: Releases exclusive access, allowing other applications to receive events.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use keyrx_daemon::platform::{InputDevice, DeviceError};
///
/// fn process_input<I: InputDevice>(mut input: I) -> Result<(), DeviceError> {
///     input.grab()?;
///
///     loop {
///         match input.next_event() {
///             Ok(event) => println!("Event: {:?}", event),

///             Err(e) => return Err(e),
///         }
///     }
///
///     input.release()?;
///     Ok(())
